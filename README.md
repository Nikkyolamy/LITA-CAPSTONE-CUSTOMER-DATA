This is where I documented my  captone project with the Incubator Hub 
## Project Title: Customer Data Analysis

This data analysis project aims to analyze and generate insight into the customer data for a subscription service to identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, i gathered enough insight into the problems and proferred the best possible solutions through compelling stories.

5. subscription start
6. subscription end
7. canceled
8. revenue

This Project was designed to address the foloowing
1. Understand the reasons behind the high cancellation rate (41K out of 75K customers canceled), especially with the significant drop-off after 12 months.
2. Examine customer preferences across Basic, Premium, and Standard subscription types to determine which offerings generate the most interest and revenue.
3. Analyze customer distribution and cancellation rates across regions (North, East, South, and West) to identify any regional variations in customer behavior.

5. Investigate the average subscription duration across different plans
